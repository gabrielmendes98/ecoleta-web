`The project that was done during the course was finalized, but I am still adding some more features. Soon after that, I will deploy the application.`

This is the web interface of the Ecoleta project developed during Rocketseat's Next Level Week.

This project was created using basically react, typescript, axios, react-icons, leaflet (to create the map) and react-dropzone to upload images.

## Instalation

`npm install`

## Start the app

`npm start`

## Live demo

Coming soon...
